# pass-safari-autofill
A (very) basic Safari Autofill for pass (www.passwordstore.org)

This script should prompt for the password to fill in (defaulting to the front window in Safari), then focus Safari and type in username and password.

This was cobbled together from a few sources and very basic Applescript knowledge, if you find this and can improve on it, send a pull request!
